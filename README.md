# Generic Web App

## Introduction
This is a the Web App created by following AWs's [Build a Serverless Web Application](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/) project.


I plan on enhancing into a photo gallery inspired by [Uploading Photos to Amazon S3 from a Browser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-example-photo-album.html) from AWS's [JavaScript SDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html).

## Deploying

### AWS Setup
You'll need to [setup your AWS Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

### Terraform Setup
This uses [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) to make sure you're using the correcet version of Terraform.

To make sure you have the correct version of terraform installed, run from the project's root folder:
```
tfenv install
```
